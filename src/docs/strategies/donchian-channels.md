# Donchian Channels
## Rationale
If hits a 4 week high then indication is a strong uptrend. Best used on daily timeframe. More of a notifcation strategy
### Triggers
- Buy 
  - if current high > donchian high
- Sell
  - if current low < donchian low>
## Indicators
-   Donchian
## Backtest Results
Only good for liquid pairs. BTC USDT. ETH, etc
### Issues
1.  Hekin Ashi updates every hour so what starts as Green could be RED in next hour and force a sell. Or Vice versa. 
### ToDo
- [ ] Backtest and implement on daily
